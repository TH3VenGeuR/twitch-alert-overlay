# Twitch Alert Overlay

A simple follower alert overlay for OBS that displays a list of the latest followers approximately every 60 seconds.

_Note: This project uses the `docs/` folder for web related files: `.html`, `.css`, `.js` etc. I do this because the project is hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)._

## Parameters

### `login`

Default `joekombo`. Enter the login name for a Twitch user.

### `volume`

Default `25`. Percentage from `0` to `100`.

### `sound`

Default `guitar`. Must match a filename found in `docs/sounds`

### `gif`

Default `guitarkitty`. Positioned in the bottom left of screen. Must match a filename found in `docs/images`.

### `clientid`

Required. [Create an application at dev.twitch.tv](https://dev.twitch.tv) and use that client id for `clientid`.

### `token`

Required. 

[Install the lates twitch CLI](https://github.com/twitchdev/twitch-cli/releases)

[Create an OAuth token using twitch-cli dev.twitch.tv/](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/cli/token-command) and use that for `token`.


_Note: Be patient.  The notifications may take up to 60 seconds to show for the first time.  **Before going live change name back to your login!**_

## Application Settings

I use the following application settings at [dev.twitch.tv](https://dev.twitch.tv) to obtain my Client ID. The Client ID can be found near the bottom.
